# Civil Engineering AI Agents Project

Welcome to the **Civil Engineering AI Agents Project**! This repository brings together a suite of specialized civil engineering AI agents, a high-performance FastAPI backend, and an interactive LLM conversation UI, all in one integrated platform.

## Overview

This project is designed to streamline and enhance civil engineering workflows. By leveraging advanced data processing, machine learning models, and intuitive conversational interfaces, our system supports a wide range of applications—from structural analysis and resource management to environmental impact assessments.

## Key Components

- **Civil Engineering Agents:**  
  Specialized AI modules tailored to address distinct civil engineering challenges. These agents analyze real-world engineering data to deliver actionable insights and predictions.

- **FastAPI Backend:**  
  A robust and scalable API framework that manages data ingestion, processing, and agent orchestration. Built with FastAPI, our backend ensures high performance and seamless integration with external systems.

- **Frontend LLM Conversation UI:**  
  An interactive user interface powered by large language models (LLMs) that enables natural language interactions. This conversational UI simplifies data querying and makes complex analyses accessible to all users.
